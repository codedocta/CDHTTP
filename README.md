# cd_http

`cd_http` is a simple, yet powerful Python package for handling HTTP requests. Built on top of the popular `requests` library, it offers a streamlined interface for sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, handling proxies, and downloading files. This package is perfect for applications that require basic HTTP interactions with custom configurations.

## Features

- **Simplified HTTP Requests**: Easily send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Proxy Support**: Configure HTTP requests to go through proxies with or without authentication.
- **User-Agent Customization**: Set custom user-agent strings for your requests.
- **Session Management**: Supports persistent sessions for multiple requests.
- **File Download Utility**: Facilitate the downloading of files from URLs.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle request errors and exceptions.

## Installation

To install `cd_http`, run:

```bash
pip install cd_http
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Here's how to send a simple GET request:

```python
from cd_http import HTTP

http_client = HTTP()
response = http_client.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)
```

### POST Request

Sending a POST request with data:

```python
response = http_client.post("https://example.com/post", data={'key': 'value'})
```

### Using Proxies

To send a request through a proxy:

```python
response = http_client.get("https://example.com", proxy="http://proxyserver:port")
```

For a proxy requiring authentication:

```python
response = http_client.get("https://example.com", proxy="http://proxyserver:port", proxy_username="user", proxy_password="password")
```

### Downloading Files

Download a file from a URL:

```python
http_client.download_file("path/to/save/file.jpg", "https://example.com/image.jpg")
```

### Persistent Sessions

Start a persistent session for multiple requests:

```python
http_client.start_session()
# Make multiple requests
http_client.close_session()
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests
